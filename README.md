### **UX/Product Design/Product Research:**
* [A collection of various company's design principles ](https://www.designprinciplesftw.com/)
* [Nielsen Norman - UX Careers](https://www.nngroup.com/reports/user-experience-careers/): Fantastic overview of UX Careers by Nielsen Norman - talks about skills common to designers, nuances between Designers vs. Researchers, and more.
* [UX Design vs UI Design](https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=5CxXhyhT6Fc): Short 10 minute video on the main differences between the two fields. The reality is that most organizations combine the roles, but UX and UI are different skills technically. UI is about the visual components of an experience (typography, colors, spacing, information architecture) and UX is about the user journey (think emotions, personas).
* [What is a Design Sprint](https://medium.com/@adam.fard/ux-design-sprint-setting-it-up-for-success-9a00de8069f8): Super common term thrown around in the design world - TLDR: a design sprint is a condensed 5 day cycle where a team of designers will go from ideation to testing with users. I almost see it as a 5 day hackathon.
* [What is wireframing/prototyping? ](https://medium.com/thinking-design/everything-you-need-to-know-about-wireframes-and-prototypes-76f828a1bcbc)
* An example of a Design System:https://polaris.shopify.com/ or https://mui.com/
* [UX Research](https://www.userinterviews.com/ux-research-field-guide-module/ux-research-basics): Great resource breaking down what UX Research entails!
* [Fixing product design career paths with the Mirror Model](https://uxdesign.cc/fixing-product-design-career-paths-with-the-mirror-model-76152b7e547): Some thoughts on the lack of clarity for growth opportunities related to tenured, individual contributor Designers. Proposes a mirroring of the Engineering progression frameworks as a solution. Thought it makes alot of sense given the alignment that occurs between the trifecta (UX/Engineering/Product).
* [UX Study Guides - Nielsen Norman](https://www.nngroup.com/topic/study-guide/): great primers on various UX topics, free resource.

### **Trust & Information Security:**
* [Common Cyberattacks](https://www.fortinet.com/resources/cyberglossary/types-of-cyber-attacks)

* [OWASP](https://owasp.org/): Industry practices on software and network security.
* [What is Security Engineering](https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/security-engineering) and [Part 2](https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/security-engineering-part-2): Great piece from Pragmatic Engineer that walks through the common myths of App Sec, its evolution throughout the years and how it integrates into the software development lifecycle.

## Technology Talent Communities (Job Boards, Slack Channels, Diversity in Tech Partners, etc) - Not updating
* I firmly believe in the importance of understanding the business areas/groups that you support as a recruiter. I have included online communities & channels that a technical recruiter can engage & partner with. As always, I believe it's important to acknowledge that these communities are not just used for recruitment so please abide community engagement rules in each respective channel.
* NOTE: I merged this section from my old content and didn't have enough time to fix the mark-up. Work In-Progress!
